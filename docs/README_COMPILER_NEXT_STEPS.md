# Goo Compiler Next Steps

This document outlines the immediate steps to continue implementing the Goo compiler to achieve a fully functional compiler capable of self-hosting the standard library.

## Overview of Started Components

We've created initial skeleton implementations for important compiler components:

1. **Type Checker**: A placeholder implementation for checking types in Goo programs
   - Located at `src/compiler/type_checker.c` and `src/include/type_checker.h`
   - Defines basic type compatibility rules and type checking for different AST nodes
   - Currently needs integration with existing code and completion of missing functions

2. **Implementation Plan**: A comprehensive plan for completing the compiler
   - Located at `COMPILER_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`
   - Outlines all necessary components and estimated timelines
   - Provides a roadmap for implementation

## Immediate Next Steps

To continue development, follow these steps:

1. **Fix Header File Integration**:
   - The current implementation has placeholder declarations for type system structures
   - Create or update the following header files:
     - `src/include/type_table.h` - Define type representation and operations
     - `src/include/symbol_table.h` - Define symbol table for name resolution

2. **Define Core Type Structures**:
   - Implement the actual `GooType` struct with all necessary type kinds
   - Complete the enumerations for type kinds (primitive, struct, interface, etc.)
   - Create utility functions for type comparisons and operations

3. **Integrate with Existing Codebase**:
   - Update the main compiler flow in `src/main.c` to call the type checker
   - Link the parser output to the type checker input
   - Ensure the type checker output feeds into the code generator

4. **Implementation Order**:
   1. Start with implementing `type_table.c` to define the type system
   2. Implement `symbol_table.c` for name resolution and scope management
   3. Complete missing functions in `type_checker.c`
   4. Integrate with the parser and code generator components

## Testing Strategy

1. Create unit tests for each type system component
   - Test type compatibility rules
   - Test type checking for different AST nodes
   - Test symbol table operations

2. Create integration tests for the type checker
   - Test handling of complex Goo code with multiple types
   - Test error reporting and recovery
   - Test handling of generics and interfaces

## Estimated Effort

Based on the current state of the codebase, completing the core type system and type checker will require:

- 2-3 weeks of focused development
- Approximately 3000-4000 lines of code
- Testing effort of approximately 1 week

After completing the type system and type checker, you'll be ready to move on to enhancing the code generator to support all language features required for self-hosting the standard library.

## Resources

- Refer to the language specification for type system details
- Look at existing code in `src/codegen` and `src/parser` for integration points
