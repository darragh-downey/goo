# Goo Optimizer Implementation

This PR introduces a complete optimizer implementation for the Goo compiler, built with Zig for performance and memory safety while maintaining C compatibility through a clean API.

## Key Components

1. **Intermediate Representation (IR)**
   - Core data structures for representing code: Module, Function, BasicBlock, Instruction, and Value
   - Support for control flow, data flow, and type information
   - Designed for efficient analysis and transformation

2. **Pass Manager**
   - Manages the execution of optimization passes
   - Configurable optimization levels
   - Collects and reports optimization statistics
   - Thread-safe operation

3. **Optimization Passes**
   - **Constant Folding**: Evaluates constant expressions at compile time
   - **Dead Code Elimination**: Removes unreachable blocks and unused instructions

4. **C API**
   - Complete bindings for using the optimizer from C
   - Clean, documented interface
   - Support for creating, manipulating, and optimizing IR
   - Memory management functions to prevent leaks

## Technical Highlights

- **Memory Safety**: Built with Zig to leverage its memory safety features
- **Performance**: Designed for efficient optimization of large codebases
- **Extensibility**: Architecture supports easy addition of new optimization passes
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite including both Zig and C tests

## Getting Started

See the `src/compiler/optimizer/README.md` for usage instructions and examples.

## Future Work

- Additional optimization passes: loop optimizations, inlining, etc.
- Profile-guided optimization support
- Parallel pass execution
- Integration with LLVM for backend optimization
