# Memory Management, Capability System, and Error Handling Implementation

This document provides an overview of the memory management, capability system, and error handling implementations for Phase 2 of the Goo compiler.

## Memory Management System

The Goo memory management system provides flexible allocation strategies that allow for efficient memory usage patterns while maintaining safety. The implementation includes:

### Core Allocation Strategies

1. **Arena Allocator**
   - Fast bump-pointer allocation for bulk, short-lived memory needs
   - Efficient for temporary data structures and work areas
   - Supports single reset operation to reclaim all memory at once
   - Provides size-based page allocation for large objects

2. **Pool Allocator**
   - Efficient for fixed-size object allocation and reuse
   - Supports freeing individual objects back to the pool
   - Automatic pool growth when capacity is reached
   - Thread-safe operation with internal synchronization

3. **Custom Allocator Wrapper**
   - Unified API for different allocator types
   - Type-safe memory allocation and deallocation
   - Support for specialized allocation patterns

### Thread-Local Allocation Support

- Thread-local storage for allocators
- Fast allocation from thread-local pools without synchronization
- Support for per-goroutine allocation strategies
- Fallback to global allocators when needed

### Compiler Integration

- Support for allocation-related language constructs
- Code generation for memory management operations
- Integration with the capability system for memory safety
- Support for compile-time memory decisions

## Capability System

The capability-based security model provides fine-grained control over resource access, enhancing both safety and security in the language:

### Core Capability Features

1. **Capability Types**
   - File I/O capabilities for file system access
   - Network capabilities for socket operations
   - Process capabilities for process management
   - Memory capabilities for advanced memory operations
   - Additional system capabilities for privileged operations

2. **Capability Operations**
   - Capability checking before resource access
   - Granting capabilities to goroutines
   - Revoking capabilities from goroutines
   - Capability inheritance across goroutine boundaries

3. **Compiler Integration**
   - Support for capability attributes on functions
   - Code generation for capability checks
   - Integration with goroutine creation
   - Static analysis for capability requirements

### Safety Features

- Capability boundaries between goroutines
- Prevention of unauthorized resource access
- Compile-time and runtime capability verification
- Graceful handling of missing capabilities

## Error Handling System

The error handling system provides robust mechanisms for managing exceptional conditions and recovering from errors:

### Core Error Handling Features

1. **Panic/Recover Mechanism**
   - Thread-local panic state management
   - Support for passing arbitrary panic values
   - Structured recovery points using setjmp/longjmp
   - Automatic panic message management

2. **Try/Recover Blocks**
   - Language-level support for structured error handling
   - Variable binding for recovered error values
   - Nested try/recover support with proper scoping
   - Integration with the capability system for permission errors

3. **Error Propagation**
   - Propagation of errors across function boundaries
   - Concise syntax for error checking and forwarding
   - Support for error wrapping and context enrichment
   - Thread boundary error management

### Compiler Integration

- Code generation for try/recover blocks
- Support for error propagation syntax
- Panic insertion for capability violations
- Integration with defer statements for cleanup

### Thread Safety

- Thread-local panic state to prevent cross-thread interference
- Proper cleanup of recovery resources
- Safe panic propagation within thread boundaries
- Isolation of panics between goroutines

## Integration

The memory management, capability, and error handling systems work together to provide a comprehensive solution for resource management:

- Memory operations can require appropriate capabilities
- Allocation patterns can be controlled by capability restrictions
- Goroutines can have limited memory access based on capabilities
- Thread-local allocators respect capability boundaries
- Error handling for capability violations
- Memory safety errors surfaced through the panic system
- Capability checks that trigger recoverable panics

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite validates the implementation:

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for combined functionality
- Performance benchmarks for critical operations
- Stress tests for concurrent scenarios

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements for these systems include:

- Advanced escape analysis for better allocation decisions
- Additional specialized allocators for specific use cases
- Fine-grained capability delegation and revocation
- Enhanced static analysis for capability requirements
- Stack trace generation for panics
- Error type specialization and pattern matching
- Optimization of recovery point management
