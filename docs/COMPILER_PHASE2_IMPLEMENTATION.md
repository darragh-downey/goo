# Goo Compiler Phase 2 Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis

After examining the codebase, I've identified the following:

1. The LLVM infrastructure is set up with basic code generation support
2. The AST structure and visitor pattern are in place
3. Basic runtime support for goroutines and channels exists
4. Code generation for basic language constructs is partially implemented

## Implementation Goals

Based on the COMPILER_PHASE2_PLAN.md and the current state of the codebase, we need to focus on:

1. Complete LLVM IR generation for all AST nodes
2. Implement runtime library integration
3. Add optimization passes
4. Implement memory management integration
5. Complete concurrency support
