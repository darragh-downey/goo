# Goo Language Runtime - Phase 3 Development Plan

## Overview

Phase 3 of the Goo language runtime development focuses on developer experience, tooling, and ecosystem development. Building on the solid foundation of safety (Phase 1) and performance (Phase 2), this phase aims to make Goo more accessible and productive for developers.

## Goals

1. **Enhanced Debugging Capabilities**
   - Runtime inspection and tracing
   - Channel visualization and message flow analysis
   - Memory and resource profiling
   - Fault diagnosis tools

2. **IDE Integration**
   - Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation
   - Code completion for Goo constructs
   - Inline documentation and hover information
   - Error diagnostics and quick fixes

3. **Documentation and Examples**
   - Comprehensive API documentation
   - Pattern libraries and best practices
   - Tutorial series for common use cases
   - Migration guides for developers from other languages

4. **Developer Tooling**
   - Package management system
   - Testing framework improvements
   - Benchmarking utilities
   - Static analysis tools

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1-2: Debugging Infrastructure

1. **Runtime Inspection System**

   - Add channel and message flow tracing
   - Develop memory allocation tracking

2. **Debugging Protocol**
   - Design debug wire protocol
   - Implement breakpoints and step execution
   - Add variable inspection capabilities
   - Create debug adapter for common tools

### Week 3-4: IDE Support

1. **Language Server Implementation**

   - Code navigation (go to definition, find references)
   - Outline view and symbol navigation

2. **Code Intelligence**
   - Completion provider for standard library
   - Code snippets for common patterns
   - Signature help for functions
   - Hover documentation

### Week 5-6: Documentation System

1. **API Documentation Generator**
   - Documentation extraction from code
   - Markdown and HTML output
   - Integration with code examples
   - Versioned documentation support

2. **Learning Resources**
   - Getting started guide
   - Interactive tutorials
   - Pattern cookbook
   - Messaging system documentation

### Week 7-8: Developer Tools

1. **Package Manager**
   - Package definition format
   - Dependency resolution
   - Version management
   - Publishing and discovery tools

2. **Testing Framework**
   - Unit testing enhancements
   - Integration test support
   - Property-based testing
   - Mock objects for channels and supervision

### Week 9-10: Integration and Refinement

1. **Ecosystem Integration**
   - Editor plugins (VSCode, JetBrains, Vim, Emacs)
   - Build system integration
   - CI/CD pipeline support
   - Containerization and deployment tools

2. **User Experience Refinement**
   - Usability testing and feedback
   - Error message improvements
   - Performance profiling enhancements
   - Documentation refinement

## Key Components

### src/debug/
- `goo_inspector.h/c`: Runtime inspection API
- `goo_debugger.h/c`: Debugger implementation
- `goo_trace.h/c`: Execution and message tracing
- `goo_profiler.h/c`: Performance and resource profiling

### src/tools/
- `goo_lsp.h/c`: Language server protocol implementation
- `goo_completion.h/c`: Code completion provider
- `goo_symbols.h/c`: Symbol management and navigation
- `goo_diagnostics.h/c`: Error reporting and suggestions

### src/package/
- `goo_package.h/c`: Package definition and management
- `goo_dependency.h/c`: Dependency resolution
- `goo_repository.h/c`: Package repository interaction

### src/testing/
- `goo_unittest.h/c`: Enhanced unit testing framework
- `goo_mocks.h/c`: Mock objects for testing
- `goo_assertions.h/c`: Testing assertions and matchers
- `goo_benchmarks.h/c`: Performance benchmarking utilities

## Success Criteria

1. Complete LSP implementation compatible with major IDEs
2. Documentation coverage for 100% of public APIs
3. Debugging system capable of inspecting all runtime aspects
4. Package management system supporting dependency resolution
5. Testing framework with coverage reporting
6. At least 10 comprehensive tutorials for common patterns
7. Editor plugins for VSCode and JetBrains IDEs

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| LSP complexity | High | Medium | Start with core features, incrementally add capabilities |
| Documentation overhead | Medium | High | Automate doc generation from source, create templates |
| Debugger integration with IDEs | High | Medium | Focus on standard debug adapters, use existing protocols |
| Package system complexity | Medium | Medium | Start with minimal viable functionality, then expand |
| Testing framework adoption | Medium | Low | Ensure compatibility with existing C testing practices |

## Future Considerations

1. GUI tools for runtime visualization
2. Cloud-based package repository
3. Integration with major cloud platforms
4. Performance analysis and optimization tools
5. Support for additional IDEs and editors
