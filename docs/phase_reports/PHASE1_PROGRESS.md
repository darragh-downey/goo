## Timeline

We're on track to complete Phase 1 within the original 2-3 month timeframe. The parallel and memory systems are advancing quickly, with the vectorization and memory pool implementations now complete. We can now focus on the remaining messaging system components.

## Examples of Usage

### Parallel Execution

```c
// Create an array of 10 million integers
int* array = (int*)goo_alloc(ARRAY_SIZE * sizeof(int));

// Initialize in parallel
goo_parallel_for(0, ARRAY_SIZE, 1, init_array, &context,
                GOO_SCHEDULE_STATIC, 0, 0);

// Process in parallel with dynamic scheduling
goo_parallel_for(0, ARRAY_SIZE, 1, process_data, &context,
                GOO_SCHEDULE_DYNAMIC, 10000, 0);
```

### Memory Management

```c
// System allocator
GooAllocator* sys_alloc = goo_system_allocator_create();
void* data = sys_alloc->alloc(sys_alloc, 1024, 8, GOO_ALLOC_ZERO);

// Scope-based allocation
{
    GOO_SCOPE_ALLOC(temp_buffer, 1024);
    // Use temp_buffer...
} // temp_buffer automatically freed here

// Memory pool for efficient object allocation
GooPoolAllocator* pool = goo_pool_allocator_create(sys_alloc, sizeof(MyObject), 16, 1024);
MyObject* obj = (MyObject*)pool->allocator.alloc(&pool->allocator, sizeof(MyObject), 16, GOO_ALLOC_ZERO);
// Use obj...
pool->allocator.free(&pool->allocator, obj, sizeof(MyObject), 16);
```

### SIMD Vectorization

```c
// Initialize the vectorization subsystem
goo_vectorization_init(GOO_SIMD_AUTO);

// Create vector operation
GooVector vec_op = {
    .src1 = src_array1,
    .src2 = src_array2,
    .dst = dst_array,
    .elem_size = sizeof(float),
    .length = array_length,
    .op = GOO_VECTOR_ADD
};

// Execute vector operation with SIMD acceleration
goo_vector_execute(&vec_op);
```

### Messaging

```c
// Publisher
GooChannel* pub = goo_pub_chan(char*, 100);
goo_channel_bind(pub, GOO_PROTO_TCP, "*", 5555);
goo_channel_publish(pub, "weather", "Sunny day", 10, GOO_MSG_NONE);

// Subscriber
GooChannel* sub = goo_sub_chan(char*, 100);
goo_channel_connect(sub, GOO_PROTO_TCP, "localhost", 5555);
goo_channel_subscribe(sub, "weather", on_message, NULL);
```
