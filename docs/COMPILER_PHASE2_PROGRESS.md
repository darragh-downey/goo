  - Test capability security boundaries

## Timeline Adjustments

The project is progressing according to the timeline with the following focus for upcoming work:

- **Weeks 7-8:** Implement optimization passes and compile-time features
- **Weeks 9-10:** Testing, benchmarking, and documentation

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk:** Performance overhead of capability checking
  - **Mitigation:** Implement capability caching and optimize common paths

  - **Mitigation:** Extensive test suite and benchmarking

## Conclusion

Phase 2 implementation is progressing well with significant milestones achieved. The memory management system, capability model, error handling, and runtime integration have been implemented, providing a strong foundation for the remaining components. The focus is now shifting to optimization passes and compile-time features to complete the core functionality of Phase 2.
