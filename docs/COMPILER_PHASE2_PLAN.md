# Goo Compiler Phase 2 Implementation Plan

## Overview

Phase 2 of the Goo compiler focuses on code generation, optimization, and runtime support for the core language features, including:

1. LLVM IR generation for all AST nodes
2. Runtime library integration
3. Optimization passes for channels and goroutines
4. Memory management integration

## 1. LLVM IR Generation

### Core Types
- Implement LLVM type representations for primitive types (int, float, bool, string)
- Add support for composite types (arrays, channels, structs)
- Implement capability type system with safety checks

### Statement Generation
- Implement code generation for control flow statements (if, for, return)
- Add support for block statements and scoping
- Implement error handling with try/recover blocks

### Expression Generation
- Support for binary and unary operations
- Function calls and parameter passing
- Memory allocation and deallocation expressions
- Channel operations (send/receive)

## 2. Concurrency Support

### Goroutines
- Implement goroutine creation and scheduling
- Support for argument capture and lifetime management
- Integration with thread pool for execution

### Channels
- Complete the channel runtime implementation
- Generate code for channel creation/destruction
- Implement send/receive operations with proper synchronization
- Add support for distributed channels (using existing messaging system)

### Parallel Execution
- Implement the `go parallel` construct for data parallelism
- Add work distribution strategies for parallel blocks
- Support for shared/private variable handling

## 3. Optimization Passes

### Channel Optimizations
- Implement channel pattern specialization
- Add buffer size optimization based on usage patterns
- Optimize local-only channels to bypass network stack

### Goroutine Optimizations
- Implement inlining for simple goroutines
- Add tail-call optimization for recursive patterns
- Optimize scheduling based on workload characteristics

### Memory Optimizations
- Implement arena and pool allocator code generation
- Add escape analysis to minimize heap allocations
- Support for allocator annotations and specialization

## 4. Runtime Integration

### Runtime Library
- Complete runtime initialization and shutdown
- Implement goroutine scheduling and management
- Integrate memory allocators with runtime

### Error Handling
- Implement panic/recover mechanism
- Add stack trace generation for debugging
- Support for supervision trees and restart strategies

### Reflection Support
- Basic type introspection capabilities
- Dynamic dispatch for interface types
- Runtime type checking for capability system

## 5. Compile-time Features

### Compile-time Evaluation
- Implement constant folding and propagation
- Support for compile-time variables and expressions
- Add metaprogramming capabilities

### SIMD Support
- Generate specialized SIMD code for vector operations
- Implement platform detection and fallback strategies
- Support for explicit SIMD intrinsics

## Implementation Order

1. Core LLVM IR generation for basic types and expressions
2. Control flow statement generation
3. Function declaration and call implementation
4. Memory management integration
5. Channel and goroutine runtime implementation
6. Optimization passes
7. Error handling and supervision
8. Compile-time features and SIMD

## Testing Strategy

- Create unit tests for each code generation component
- Develop integration tests for runtime library interaction
- Build comprehensive test suite for concurrency features
- Implement benchmark suite for optimization evaluation
