# Next Steps for Goo Safety Implementation

This document outlines the roadmap for enhancing and completing the safety features in the Goo language runtime.

## Short-Term Priorities (1-3 Months)

### 1. Fix Build System and Integration

- **Resolve include path issues**: Ensure proper header file inclusion across the codebase
- **Update build scripts**: Make the build system more robust by adding proper dependencies between components
- **Integrate TSAN**: Add ThreadSanitizer support to the build system for detecting race conditions

### 2. Enhance Type Safety

- **Improve runtime type checking**:
  - Add support for generic containers with type checking
  - Implement nested type validation
  - Add support for function signatures as types

- **Complete bounds checking**:
  - Implement automatic bounds checking for arrays and buffer operations
  - Develop a bounds-checked string library
  - Add more unit tests for edge cases

### 3. Strengthen Concurrency Safety

- **Implement the atomics wrapper functions**:
  - Complete the atomic operations for all primitive types
  - Add fences and explicit barriers with proper memory ordering

- **Enhance the lock-free data structures**:
  - Implement and test a lock-free stack
  - Develop a multi-producer/multi-consumer queue
  - Add proper ABA prevention mechanisms

- **Improve thread pool implementation**:
  - Implement work stealing for better load balancing
  - Add priorities for tasks
  - Implement cancellation support

## Medium-Term Goals (3-6 Months)

### 1. Compiler Integration

- **Add static analysis tools**:
  - Integrate with Clang analyzer
  - Develop custom lint rules for Goo safety conventions
  - Generate warnings for unsafe constructs

- **Add compiler extensions**:
  - Implement annotations for static safety checking
  - Add automatic generation of runtime checks

### 2. Formal Verification

- **Add contracts and invariants**:
  - Implement design by contract features
  - Add runtime validation of pre/post conditions
  - Support for class/struct invariants

- **Model checking integration**:
  - Add support for model checking concurrent algorithms
  - Integrate with existing formal verification tools

### 3. Vectorization Safety

- **Extend SIMD safety**:
  - Complete safety wrappers for all SIMD operations
  - Add automatic bounds checking for vectorized loops
  - Develop safety tools for cross-lane operations

- **Architecture-specific optimizations**:
  - Optimize for ARM NEON while maintaining safety
  - Add AVX-512 support with safety checks
  - Handle different alignment requirements safely

## Long-Term Vision (6+ Months)

### 1. Memory Safety

- **Reference Counting and Ownership**:
  - Implement safe reference counting with cycle detection
  - Add ownership semantics similar to Rust
  - Develop tools to detect use-after-free and double-free

- **Garbage Collection**:
  - Optional precise garbage collection
  - Incremental collection to minimize pauses
  - Integration with manual memory management

### 2. Distribution Safety

- **Safe Distributed Computing**:
  - Type-safe serialization/deserialization
  - End-to-end encryption for data transfer
  - Safe distributed algorithms with fault tolerance

- **Network Resilience**:
  - Session resumption after network failures
  - Message replay protection
  - Rate limiting and backpressure

### 3. Language Evolution

- **Language-Level Safety Features**:
  - Dependent types for stronger type safety
  - Effect systems for tracking side effects
  - Gradual typing for migrating legacy code

- **Safe Foreign Function Interface**:
  - Type-safe FFI with automatic marshalling
  - Bounds checking for foreign memory access
  - Memory isolation for external code

## Implementation Strategy

For each feature, we will follow this process:

1. **Design**: Create a detailed specification document
2. **Prototype**: Implement a minimal working version
3. **Test**: Develop comprehensive tests, including edge cases
4. **Review**: Perform code review focused on safety
5. **Document**: Update documentation and examples
6. **Release**: Integrate into the main codebase

## Performance Considerations

All safety features should be:

- **Configurable**: Enable/disable at compile time or runtime
- **Bounded overhead**: Maximum overhead target of 15% in debug mode, 5% in release mode
- **Optimizable**: Compilers should be able to optimize away checks when safe

## Measuring Success

We will track our success using the following metrics:

- **Coverage**: Percentage of codebase covered by safety features
- **Bugs prevented**: Number of bugs caught by safety features
- **Performance impact**: Overhead of safety features in benchmarks
- **Adoption**: Developer usage of safety features in application code
