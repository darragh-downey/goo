# Zig 0.14.0 Upgrade Report for Goo

## Summary

We have successfully upgraded the build system and core SIMD functionality to work with Zig 0.14.0. The basic vector operations and SIMD detection are working properly, but there are several issues that need to be fixed in the full codebase.

## What Works

- ✅ Basic SIMD detection works with Zig 0.14.0
- ✅ SIMD vectorization and vector operations work properly
- ✅ The build system has been updated to correctly build with Zig 0.14.0
- ✅ The basic SIMD test runs successfully with aligned memory and vector operations

## Issues To Fix

1. **Struct Redefinitions**:
   - `GooVectorOperation` is defined twice (once in `goo_vectorization.h` and once in `goo_comptime_simd.h`)
   - The solution is to rename the structure in `goo_comptime_simd.h` to avoid conflicts

2. **Enum Redefinitions**:
   - Supervision strategy enumerators are defined both in `goo.h` and `goo_runtime.h`:
     - `GOO_SUPERVISE_ONE_FOR_ONE`
     - `GOO_SUPERVISE_ONE_FOR_ALL`
     - `GOO_SUPERVISE_REST_FOR_ONE`
   - The solution is to update `goo_runtime.h` to use the enums from `goo.h` instead of redefining them

3. **Unused Parameters**:
   - `arg` in `goo_worker_thread`
   - `error_info` in `goo_supervise_handle_error`
   - These can be fixed by either using the parameters or marking them as unused with `(void)parameter_name;`

## Next Steps

1. Fix the struct redefinitions by renaming `GooVectorOperation` in `goo_comptime_simd.h` to a different name
2. Fix the enum redefinitions in `goo_runtime.h` by including `goo.h` and using the enums from there
3. Fix the unused parameters in `goo_runtime.c` by either using them or explicitly marking them as unused
4. After these fixes, run the full SIMD tests again to verify everything works

## Conclusion

The core SIMD functionality of the Goo language is working with Zig 0.14.0. The upgrade process revealed some issues with type redefinitions and unused parameters that need to be addressed, but these are straightforward fixes. Once these issues are fixed, the full Goo compiler should be compatible with Zig 0.14.0.
