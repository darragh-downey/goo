# Goo Project Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the cleanup work performed on the Goo project to reorganize the codebase according to the new directory structure.

## Directory Structure Migration

The project has been reorganized according to the following structure:

- `include/goo/` - Public headers
  - `core/` - Core components
    - `lexer/` - Lexer public interfaces
    - `parser/` - Parser public interfaces
    - `ast/` - AST public interfaces
  - `runtime/` - Runtime libraries
  - `utils/` - Utility libraries

- `src/compiler/` - Compiler implementation
  - `frontend/` - Frontend components
    - `lexer/` - Lexer implementation
    - `parser/` - Parser implementation
  - `ast/` - AST implementation
  - `type/` - Type system
  - `optimizer/` - Optimization passes
  - `backend/` - Code generation

- `scripts/` - Build and utility scripts

## Cleanup Scripts

Several scripts were created to assist with the migration and cleanup:

1. `scripts/setup_structure.sh` - Creates the new directory structure
2. `scripts/migrate_lexer.sh` - Migrates the lexer component to the new structure
3. `scripts/update_includes.sh` - Updates include paths in the migrated files
4. `scripts/fix_includes.sh` - Simplified script to fix include paths
5. `scripts/cleanup.sh` - Removes redundant files after migration
6. `scripts/check_redundant.sh` - Checks for redundant files without deleting
7. `scripts/clean_zig_cache.sh` - Cleans Zig cache directories

## Cleanup Actions Performed

The following actions were performed during the cleanup:

1. Created a new directory structure following the organization plan
2. Migrated lexer component to the new structure
3. Updated include paths in migrated files
4. Created placeholder files for any missing dependencies
5. Updated the build system to support both old and new structures
6. Removed redundant files that were migrated to the new structure
7. Cleaned up build artifacts and cache files

## Remaining Tasks

- Migrate parser component to the new structure
- Migrate AST component to the new structure
- Update tests to work with the new structure
- Add comprehensive documentation for the new organization
- Implement continuous integration that builds with the new structure

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Components

When adding new components to the project:

1. Place public headers in `include/goo/core/{component}/`
2. Place implementation files in `src/compiler/{category}/{component}/`
3. Update the build system to include the new component
4. Create appropriate tests in `tests/unit/{component}/`

### Modifying Existing Components

When modifying existing components:

1. Check if the component has been migrated to the new structure
2. If not, consider migrating it before making changes
3. Update both old and new structures during the transition period
4. Ensure all include paths are correct
5. Test both the old and new structures

### Build System

The build system has been updated to support both old and new structures:

- The top-level Makefile detects which structure to use
- Component-specific Makefiles handle building the components
- Use `make info` to see which structure is being used

## Recovery Options

If you encounter issues with the new structure:

1. Restore from backups: `cp -r backups/src/lexer/* src/lexer/`
2. Restore the Makefile: `cp backups/Makefile Makefile`
3. Revert to the old structure by using the old Makefile: `cp Makefile.old Makefile`

## Future Cleanup

As components are migrated to the new structure, periodically run:

1. `./scripts/check_redundant.sh` to identify redundant files
2. `./scripts/cleanup.sh` to remove redundant files
3. `./scripts/clean_zig_cache.sh` to clean up Zig cache files
