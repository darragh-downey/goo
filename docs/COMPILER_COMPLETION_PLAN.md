## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Timeframe | Dependencies |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Type System | Weeks 1-3 | None |
| AST Enhancements | Weeks 2-4 | Type System (partial) |
| Code Generation | Weeks 4-8 | Type System, AST Enhancements |
| Runtime System | Weeks 5-8 | Concurrent with Code Generation |
| Standard Library Interface | Weeks 7-9 | Type System, Runtime System |
| Self-Hosted Components | Weeks 8-12 | All previous phases |
| Packaging | Weeks 11-13 | All previous phases |

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Complete the type checker implementation
2. Enhance the existing AST representation
3. Finish LLVM IR generation for all language constructs
4. Implement initial garbage collection
5. Create basic standard library definitions

With this plan completed, the Goo language will be capable of self-hosting its standard library and will provide a solid foundation for further language evolution.
