# Goo Runtime

This directory contains the runtime implementation for the Goo programming language.

## Overview

The runtime provides essential services that support Goo programs during execution, including:

- **Memory Management**: Allocation, deallocation, and garbage collection
- **Concurrency**: Thread management and synchronization primitives
- **Messaging**: Channel-based communication
- **Safety**: Runtime safety checks and protection mechanisms
- **I/O**: Input/output operations and system interface

## Directory Structure

- `memory/` - Memory management and allocation
- `concurrency/` - Threading and parallel execution
- `messaging/` - Inter-process and channel communication
- `safety/` - Runtime safety checks and protections
- `io/` - Input/output abstractions

## Development Guidelines

When working on the runtime:

1. Performance is critical - be mindful of overhead
2. Thread safety must be considered in all components
3. Error handling should be comprehensive
4. Document memory ownership and lifecycle
5. Write thorough tests, especially for edge cases
6. Follow the [project coding style](../../CODING_STYLE.md)

## API Documentation

The public API for the runtime is documented in the `include/goo/runtime/` directory.
