# Goo Compiler

This directory contains the compiler implementation for the Goo programming language.

## Overview

The compiler is organized as a pipeline with the following major components:

- **Frontend**: Responsible for source code processing, including lexical and syntax analysis
- **AST**: Abstract Syntax Tree representation of the parsed source code
- **Type**: Type checking and type inference systems
- **Analysis**: Semantic analysis and code validation
- **Backend**: Code generation and optimization for target platforms

## Directory Structure

- `frontend/` - Source processing
  - `lexer/` - Tokenization and lexical analysis
  - `parser/` - Syntax analysis and AST generation
- `ast/` - Abstract syntax tree definitions and utilities
- `type/` - Type system implementation
- `analysis/` - Semantic analysis and validation
- `backend/` - Code generation and linking
- `optimizer/` - Optimization passes and transformations

## Development Guidelines

When working on the compiler:

1. Use consistent naming for compiler passes and components
2. Document all major interfaces and algorithms
3. Write unit tests for each component
4. Maintain separation between compiler phases
5. Follow the [project coding style](../../CODING_STYLE.md)
