# Goo Optimizer Component Overview

This document provides an overview of the Goo Optimizer component, implemented in Zig with C bindings for seamless integration with the rest of the Goo compiler.

## Component Structure

The Goo Optimizer consists of the following key components:

### 1. Core IR Implementation

The core Intermediate Representation (IR) system is implemented in Zig:

- **ir.zig**: Defines the core IR data structures (Module, Function, BasicBlock, Instruction, Value)
- **pass_manager.zig**: Provides the optimization pipeline infrastructure
- **constant_folding.zig**: Implements constant folding optimization pass

### 2. C API Bindings

To integrate with the C-based compiler:

- **goo_optimizer.h**: C header defining the public optimizer API
- **bindings.zig**: Implements the bridge between Zig and C
- **constant_folding_bindings.zig**: Specific bindings for the constant folding pass

### 3. Tests

The component includes comprehensive tests:

- Zig unit tests for the IR, pass manager, and specific passes
- C API tests in `test/optimizer_test.c` to validate the C interface

### 4. Build System

The build system is designed for easy integration:

- **build.zig**: Zig build script to compile the Zig components
- **Makefile**: Coordinates the build process for both Zig and C components
- **build.sh**: Shell script for building, testing, and installing the optimizer

## Key Features

The Zig-based optimizer provides several advantages:

1. **Memory Safety**: Leverage Zig's memory safety features to prevent common bugs
2. **Performance**: Utilize Zig's focus on performance for faster optimization passes
3. **C Integration**: Seamless integration with the existing C codebase
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new optimization passes

## Implemented Optimizations

Currently, the following optimizations are implemented:

1. **Constant Folding**: Evaluates constant expressions at compile time

## Future Extensions

Planned optimization passes include:

1. **Dead Code Elimination**: Remove unreachable or unused code
2. **Common Subexpression Elimination**: Eliminate redundant computations
3. **Function Inlining**: Replace function calls with function bodies
4. **Loop Optimizations**: Unrolling, fusion, and other loop transformations

## Using the Optimizer

The optimizer can be used from C code via the public API defined in `goo_optimizer.h`. It provides functions to:

1. Create and manipulate IR
2. Configure the optimization pipeline
3. Run optimizations on IR
4. Access the optimized code for code generation

See `test/optimizer_test.c` for examples of using the optimizer API.

## Building and Testing

To build the optimizer:

```bash
./build.sh
```

To run tests:

```bash
./build.sh --test
```

To generate documentation:

```bash
./build.sh --docs
```

To install the optimizer:

```bash
PREFIX=/usr/local ./build.sh --install
```

## Integration with the Goo Compiler

The optimizer integrates with the Goo compiler pipeline as follows:

1. The frontend generates an AST from Goo source code
2. The AST is lowered to the IR
3. The optimizer applies transformations to the IR
4. The optimized IR is passed to the code generator

This integration allows for efficient optimization while maintaining the existing compiler architecture.
