# Optimizer Migration to Zig

This document outlines the plan for migrating the Goo compiler's optimizer components from C to Zig.

## Motivation

Migrating the optimizer to Zig provides several benefits:

1. **Memory Safety**: Zig's compile-time features help prevent memory errors
2. **Performance**: Zig's comptime evaluation allows for more efficient code generation
3. **Maintainability**: Stronger type system reduces bugs and improves code clarity
4. **Iterative Migration**: Components can be migrated incrementally while maintaining compatibility

## Migration Strategy

The migration will follow a phased approach:

### Phase 1: Groundwork (Current)

1. Create core IR (Intermediate Representation) structures in Zig
2. Implement C bindings for interoperability with existing C code
3. Write basic optimization passes in Zig
4. Create comprehensive tests for the new components

### Phase 2: Feature Parity

1. Reimplement the existing optimization passes in Zig:
   - Escape analysis
   - Channel optimizations
   - Goroutine optimizations
2. Ensure full compatibility with the existing C codebase
3. Add benchmarks to compare performance

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

1. Add new optimizations leveraging Zig's features:
   - Compile-time constant folding
   - Advanced alias analysis
   - Stronger static analysis capabilities
2. Implement parallelized optimization passes
3. Add more aggressive inlining and specialization

## Component Migration Plan

| Component | C Location | Zig Location | Priority | Complexity |
|-----------|------------|--------------|----------|------------|
| IR Definition | N/A (new) | src/compiler/optimizer/zig/ir.zig | High | Medium |
| Pass Manager | optimizer.h | src/compiler/optimizer/zig/pass_manager.zig | High | Low |
| Escape Analysis | escape_analysis.c | src/compiler/optimizer/zig/escape_analysis.zig | Medium | High |
| Channel Optimizer | channel_optimizer.c | src/compiler/optimizer/zig/channel_optimizer.zig | Medium | High |
| Goroutine Optimizer | goroutine_optimizer.c | src/compiler/optimizer/zig/goroutine_optimizer.zig | Medium | High |
| C Bindings | N/A | src/compiler/optimizer/zig/bindings.zig | High | Medium |

## Testing Strategy

1. Create unit tests for each Zig component
2. Add integration tests that validate optimizer behavior
3. Benchmark tests to compare performance with C implementations
4. Implement property-based testing where applicable

## Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Implement core IR and pass manager
- **Week 3-4**: Implement C bindings and first optimization pass
- **Week 5-8**: Migrate remaining optimization passes
- **Week 9-10**: Performance tuning and integration testing

## Success Criteria

- All tests pass for migrated components
- No regression in compilation speed
- Optimized code shows same or better performance than C version
- Clear interoperability API between C and Zig components
