# Next Steps for Lexer Migration

This document outlines the remaining tasks to complete the Goo lexer migration from Flex to Zig.

## Completed Work

- [x] Implemented the Zig lexer
- [x] Created integration tests and comparison tools
- [x] Created a unified lexer selection interface
- [x] Developed integration documentation
- [x] Created Makefile modifications for the compiler
- [x] Built comprehensive test suite for comparative validation
- [x] Implemented compiler integration simulation for testing

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Validation Testing

- [ ] Run the test suite against various Goo source files
```bash
# Run the basic test suite
cd src/lexer
./run_lexer_tests.sh

# Compare with compiler test files
./compare_compiler_lexers.sh ../../test/

# Test detailed compiler integration
./compiler_integration_test --output-tokens=tokens.txt path/to/file.goo
```

- [ ] Fix any discrepancies found between the lexers
- [ ] Ensure all edge cases are properly handled by both lexers

### 2. Main Compiler Integration

- [ ] Update the main Goo compiler Makefile following instructions in `MAKEFILE_MODIFICATIONS.md`
- [ ] Include `lexer_selection.h` in the parser code
- [ ] Initialize the lexer in the main compiler entry point

```c
// In main.c or similar file
#include "lexer/lexer_selection.h"

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    // ...existing code...
    
    // Initialize lexer with input file
    FILE* input_file = fopen(filename, "r");
    if (!input_file) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error: Cannot open file %s\n", filename);
        return 1;
    }
    
    lexer_set_file(input_file);
    fclose(input_file);
    
    // ...existing code...
    
    // Clean up lexer resources before exiting
    lexer_cleanup();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### 3. Compiler Error Handling Updates

- [ ] Update the compiler's error reporting to use the lexer's line/column tracking
- [ ] Set an error callback function to integrate with the compiler's error system

```c
// Define error callback function
void compiler_error_handler(const char* msg, int line, int column) {
    // Add to compiler's error collection or display directly
    compiler_add_error(msg, line, column, current_file);
}

// Set the callback in the lexer
lexer_set_error_callback(compiler_error_handler);
```

### 4. Full Integration Testing

- [ ] Run the full compiler test suite with the Zig lexer
- [ ] Compare outputs between Flex and Zig lexers on all test files
- [ ] Fix any discrepancies or issues found during testing

```bash
# Compare both lexers across the entire compiler test suite:
./compare_compiler_lexers.sh ../../test/ --verbose

# For specific issues, examine individual files:
./test_single_file.sh path/to/issue.goo --verbose
```

### 5. Performance Optimization

- [ ] Benchmark the Zig lexer against the Flex lexer with large input files
- [ ] Identify and address any performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Consider memory usage optimizations

```bash
# Performance comparison with timing information:
./run_lexer_tests.sh -t --test-dir path/to/large/files

# Or for specific large files:
./compiler_integration_test --zig --time path/to/large_file.goo
./compiler_integration_test --flex --time path/to/large_file.goo
```

### 6. Cleanup

- [ ] Remove dead code and unused functions
- [ ] Update all documentation to reflect the new implementation
- [ ] Consider removing Flex dependency after successful transition
- [ ] Archive the old Flex lexer code for reference

## Post-Migration Opportunities

Once the migration is complete, consider these follow-up improvements:

1. **Advanced Error Recovery**: Improve the lexer's ability to recover from errors and continue parsing.

2. **Token Position Enhancement**: Add end position tracking (not just start position) for better error messages.

3. **Zig Parser Development**: Begin planning for a Zig-based parser to replace the Bison parser.

4. **Build System Improvements**: Streamline the build process now that the Flex dependency is removed.

## Test Suite Components

The migration project includes a comprehensive test suite:

1. **Basic Test Program** (`test_lexer_integration.c`): Tests the original integration approach.

2. **Unified Test Program** (`test_lexer_selection.c`): Tests the lexer selection interface with unified output formats for straightforward comparison.

3. **Compiler Simulation** (`compiler_integration_test.c`): Simulates how the compiler uses the lexer, allowing more realistic testing.

4. **Automated Test Scripts**:
   - `run_lexer_tests.sh`: Basic test script for multiple files
   - `test_single_file.sh`: Detailed analysis for individual files
   - `compare_compiler_lexers.sh`: Processes all compiler test files, generating reports

5. **Test Files**: A variety of test files covering different language features and edge cases.

## Timeline

| Task | Estimated Time | Dependencies |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| Validation Testing | 1-2 days | None |
| Main Compiler Integration | 2-3 days | Validation Testing |
| Error Handling Updates | 1-2 days | Main Compiler Integration |
| Full Integration Testing | 2-3 days | Main Compiler Integration |
| Performance Optimization | 2-3 days | Full Integration Testing |
| Cleanup | 1-2 days | All above tasks |

## Conclusion

The lexer migration is nearing completion. We have established a robust testing framework with the following components:

1. **Lexer Selection Interface**: A unified API for both lexers allowing transparent switching
2. **Comprehensive Test Tools**: Multiple programs and scripts for testing at different levels
3. **Compiler Integration Simulation**: Realistic testing of compiler-lexer interaction
4. **Comparative Analysis Tools**: Tools to identify and fix discrepancies between implementations

The remaining tasks focus on validation, integration with the main compiler, testing, optimization, and cleanup.

When completed, this migration will not only remove the Flex dependency but also provide a more maintainable, safer, and potentially faster lexer implementation for the Goo compiler.
