# Compiler Backend Passes

This directory contains optimization passes for the Goo compiler backend.

## Overview

The optimization passes in this directory operate on the intermediate representation (IR) of the Goo compiler. These passes are designed to improve the performance, size, and efficiency of the generated code.

## Passes

- **Channel Optimization**: Optimizes channel communication patterns for better performance
- **Goroutine Optimization**: Improves goroutine scheduling and management
- **Pass Manager**: Manages the execution order and dependencies of optimization passes

## Pass Structure

Each optimization pass follows a common structure:

1. **Analysis**: Gather information about the code being optimized
2. **Transformation**: Modify the IR based on the analysis
3. **Verification**: Ensure the transformation did not break any invariants

## Development Guidelines

When developing optimization passes:

1. Each pass should have a clear, focused purpose
2. Passes should document their preconditions and postconditions
3. Passes should be composable with other passes
4. Include tests that verify correctness and effectiveness
5. Document performance impact with benchmarks
6. Follow the [project coding style](../../../../CODING_STYLE.md)
